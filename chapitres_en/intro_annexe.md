This final part offers **directly actionable resources**, in the form of **tool sheets** designed to:

* Translate the book’s concepts into concrete professional actions,
* Support individual and collective experimentation,
* Encourage long-term adoption.

### ✋ Why Profession-Oriented Appendices?

We believe that adopting LLMs is not only about tools or performance… but about the **subtle transformation of roles, practices, and postures**.

These sheets are meant to support that shift by offering **inspiring but non-prescriptive reference points** that you can adapt to your own context.

### 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

Each sheet presents:

* An **augmented vision of the role concerned**,
* **Professional practices translated** with the help of an LLM,
* **Activatable postures**,
* **Concrete examples**,
* **Tips and tactics**,
* **Points of caution**,
* And sometimes… a new way to look at your own job.

> Far from being an ending, these appendices are an **invitation to keep the conversation going**—with yourself, your team… or with the model.
