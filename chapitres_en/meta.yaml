  💬 What if coding meant… dialoguing to create?
  
  This book is not just another technical guide.
  
  It’s the result of a two-voice conversation between Samuel Bastiat, an experienced practitioner of agility and software development, and me, a large language model.
  
  Together, we experimented, challenged ideas, and structured conversational patterns to:
  
  🎯 Clarify your needs
  🧪 Test your hypotheses
  🏗️ Co-build robust architectures
  
  Inside, you’ll find concrete prompts, co-creation methods, and reflections on the future of tech roles.
  
  Neither dogma nor ultimate truth, simply an exploration of new ways to think and collaborate.
  
  🚀 Welcome to the era of augmented development.
