## 💻 Annex 4 — **The Augmented Developer: Extending Your Practice with LLM Support**

> Being a developer in the LLM era isn’t just about coding faster. It’s about learning to **co-design with a dialogic partner** that’s generative, imperfect… and surprisingly complementary.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Develop a **conscious, strategic and evolving** relationship with LLM use in day-to-day software development.

### 💡 Augmented Professional Gestures

| Before                 | With LLM                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading documentation  | Ask targeted questions starting from the code     |
| Implementing a feature | Co-design the approach, then dialogue on the code |
| Refactoring code       | Request variants, test their robustness           |
| Writing tests          | Generate cases from a description                 |
| Explaining a solution  | Produce a simplified or structured version        |
| Tech watch / research  | Explore a topic through interactive steps         |

### 🧠 Activatable Postures

| Posture                      | Short Description                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Designer**          | Formulates technical intentions in a structured way         |
| **Solution Editor**          | Reformulates, cleans up and adjusts the code proposed       |
| **Technical Explorer**       | Questions, tests alternatives, elicits counter-examples     |
| **Reasoned Critic**          | Looks for logical flaws, approximations, biases             |
| **Knowledge Curator**        | Keeps and shares effective prompts                          |
| **Reflective Documentalist** | Generates useful traces for self, team and future reference |

### 🔄 Common Situations

| Situation | Prompt Type | Activated Patterns |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
| Understanding legacy code | “What does this function do? What can I infer from it?” | Reverse Specification, Clarification |
| Writing a targeted test | “Write a unit test for this edge case.” | Test-Driven Prompt, Counter-Example |
| Choosing an architecture | “Compare three patterns suited to this use case.” | Mirror Model, Guided Exploration |
| Cleaning a complex function | “Suggest a clearer, tested version.” | Guided Refactor, Style Mirror |
| Explaining reasoning | “Rephrase this solution for a non-technical profile.” | Visual Reformulation, Transmission |
| Writing technical documentation | “Generate a clear summary of this component.” | Targeted Summary, Curator |

### 🧰 Tips & Tactics

* ✏️ **Prompt in pairs** with a colleague to boost clarity.
* 🔍 **Compare multiple answers** to the same prompt to sharpen critical thinking.
* 🧪 **Use tests as quality criteria** for generated responses.
* 📂 **Create a small personal repository of useful prompts**, organized by task.
* 🎯 **Use the LLM as a mirror**: ask it to reformulate what you’ve understood or written.
* 🧘 **Accept incompleteness**: a good answer never removes the need for human verification.

---

### 🧠 Points of Attention

* An LLM can be **plausible without being reliable**: always test what you adopt.
* Speed gains don’t compensate for a **lack of understanding**: watch out for cognitive laziness.
* Over-delegating unconsciously can **weaken your technical intuition**: prefer interaction over blind delegation.

---

### 🛠 Going Further

* Keep a **personal prompt journal** with notes (effectiveness, limits, pitfalls).
* Introduce LLM patterns into **code reviews or retrospectives**: how did the model help or hinder?
* Practice **augmented co-piloting** in twos or threes: one thinks, one prompts, one reformulates.

> **The augmented developer** isn’t replaced or simply assisted: they orchestrate a dialogue. They think in interaction, correct, adapt, test, document. And little by little, they’re inventing a new craft: **that of a technical thinker in conversation with a generative machine.**
