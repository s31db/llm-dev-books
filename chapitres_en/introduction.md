## 🧩 Introduction — Designing with AI: a new software craft

> *It’s not so much the code that changes as our way of designing it.*

Software design has always been about dialogue — dialogue between people, between ideas, between abstractions and constraints.
What’s changing today isn’t just the arrival of powerful new tools, but the possibility of a **dialogue with a model**. A structured, iterative, sometimes unsettling dialogue — and yet full of potential.

This book starts from a simple observation: **working with an LLM doesn’t automate design — it changes its dynamics.**
The skills you need are no longer purely technical but also conversational, reflective, and structuring.

Designing with an LLM isn’t about asking a question and waiting for the perfect answer. It’s about practicing an art of interaction: framing clearly, bouncing back with discernment, testing rigorously, documenting carefully. It’s about **orchestrating distributed reasoning**, drawing on the model’s strengths without surrendering your own judgment.

### 🧠 Why a Pattern Language?

We’re not starting from scratch. In software, we’ve learned to structure collective experience through *design patterns*, best practices, and frameworks. This book proposes an approach in that lineage: **a pattern language for designing in interaction with an LLM**.

These patterns aren’t recipes or tricks. They’re recurring forms of exchange observed, tested, and refined in varied contexts: code reviews, architecture, documentation, teaching. Each pattern starts from a concrete situation, identifies a typical problem, and proposes a structured response — often more conversational than technical.

The goal isn’t to freeze methods but to **equip emerging practices**: to let individual developers or teams recognize familiar situations, approach them with a shared vocabulary, and — above all — build their own ways of working.

### 🧭 Who Is This Book For?

For you, developer, who feels your tools are evolving faster than your bearings.

For you, facilitator, architect, coach, who sees new, improvised, sometimes powerful uses appearing in teams.

For you, trainer or researcher, who wants to document these transformations without reducing them to a fad.

For you, Product Owner, looking to clarify fuzzy needs, explore options without doing all the framing alone, and turn an LLM into a co-design partner rather than a mere user-story generator.

For you, holistic troubleshooter, who refuses to stop at symptoms and probes the deeper causes of a problem by mapping assumptions, crossing viewpoints, and identifying systemic roots before proposing durable, shared actions — with the attentive help of an LLM acting as both critical mirror and analytical support.

And maybe for you, who doesn’t yet use an LLM daily — but senses there’s more here than just autocomplete.

### 📚 How to Read This Book?

This isn’t an AI manual or an exhaustive guide. It’s a **conversational toolbox**, an atlas of practices, a modest manifesto.
You can read it end to end or dip into a pattern as needed.

You’ll find here:

* frameworks for thinking about interaction,
* operational patterns to try in your context,
* concrete experience reports,
* ways to teach, adapt, and bring these practices to life.

### 🎤 And Now?

This book doesn’t claim to hold the answers. But it does offer a language for asking better questions — with, and sometimes against, the model. Because that’s where the real challenge lies: not in the exactness of the answers generated, but in the **quality of the dialogue we’re able to build with this new form of intelligence**.

Welcome to this emerging grammar. It belongs to you as much as to us.
