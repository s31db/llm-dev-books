## 🔮 Chapter 13 — Forward-Looking Scenarios: Toward Generative Conversational Engineering

What if, tomorrow, software development was no longer a process centered on code, but a series of dialogues, progressive validations, and fluid co-designs between humans and conversational agents?
What if some teams were composed only of roles focused on supervision, validation, and orchestration?

This chapter explores several scenarios at the edge of the plausible to question the possible futures of augmented development.

### The “Full-LLM” Team: One Human Operator for Five Specialized Agents

In this configuration, a human no longer writes code directly but orchestrates a set of specialized conversational agents:

* **An architecture agent** to model structural choices, dependencies, and patterns.
* **A front-end agent** focused on design systems, accessibility, and UX consistency.
* **A back-end agent** focused on APIs, performance, and security.
* **A testing agent** generating test cases, checking edge conditions, and building mocks.
* **A semantics agent** responsible for documentation, explanatory diagrams, and conceptual coherence.

The human interacts in natural language with these agents.
Their role? Set the frame, arbitrate, and validate iterations.

> **Excerpt from a fictional dialogue:**
>
> **Human:** I want a REST API to manage a shared calendar between users.
>
> **Architecture Agent:** I suggest a hexagonal architecture with PostgreSQL storage and auth middleware. OK?
>
> **Human:** Add fine-grained permissions. Front-end, are you following?
>
> **Front-end Agent:** Yes, I’ll generate a React interface with Tailwind, with conditional access by role.
>
> **Human:** Tester, create a critical test plan for concurrent access.
>
> **Testing Agent:** Generating…
>
> **Human:** Semantics, document the permission scheme in plain language.
>
> **Semantics Agent:** Here’s a first version.

This kind of scenario is still speculative, but the technological building blocks are maturing fast.

### Dialogue-Driven Generative Architecture

In traditional approaches, software architecture is fixed up front or changed at high cost.
In an augmented approach, it becomes **evolving, exploratory, and dialogic**.

The architect converses with a model that:

* proposes multiple patterns according to expressed needs (scalability, auditability, latency…),
* anticipates friction or entropy points (e.g., overly granular microservices),
* simulates future scenarios (feature additions, cloud migration, GDPR adaptation…).

> **Example:** “If tomorrow we had to support offline mobile users, would our architecture hold?” — The model can simulate necessary adaptations (local caching, deferred sync, message queues…).

The architect’s role shifts to that of a **storyteller of technical trajectories** rather than the builder of a fixed plan.

### Conversational Design as a Form of Development

Software development is increasingly a dialogue — with users, with teammates, with AIs.
**Conversational design** becomes a core skill:

* **How do you ask the right questions to surface a solution?**
* **How do you guide the AI toward a precise intent without over-specifying?**
* **How do you visually represent an emerging line of reasoning?**

This design is no longer just chatbot UX. It becomes the **core of interaction with systems**.

> **Workshop “Prompt-Design as Code”**
>
> In some teams, structuring prompts are versioned, tested, and reviewed like code. They apply readability, modularity, and robustness patterns. The prompt becomes a central project artifact, not just a temporary tool.

### Toward a New Engineering: Augmented, Exploratory, Reflective

These scenarios outline the contours of a profoundly transformed engineering practice:

* **Skills shift** from syntax mastery to anticipation, orchestration, and critical review.
* **Roles become fluid**, blending design, modeling, facilitation, and testing in short dialogue cycles.
* **Tools become reasoning partners**, able to simulate, reformulate, and propose.

It’s not so much AI replacing developers as engineering itself becoming **a space for reasoned conversations guided by intent, rigor, and ethics**.
