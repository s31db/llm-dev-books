### 🙋 A Question That Comes Up Often

“Are you letting an AI do your job now?”
“Do you code or just copy/paste what ChatGPT tells you?”
“Don’t you feel like you’re cheating?”

If you’ve already used an LLM in your work as a developer, you’ve probably heard — or thought — remarks like these. Beneath them lies a broader question: **to what extent does using AI challenge our professional legitimacy?**

---

### 🧠 Working with AI Is Not Delegating Your Job

Using an LLM doesn’t mean “outsourcing your brain.” It means **integrating your expertise with a generative tool**. And that requires specific skills:

* Framing the intent and reformulating it,
* Judging the quality of a response,
* Iterating, testing, validating,
* Adapting to the project’s context, style, and architecture,
* Documenting and transmitting what has been co-produced.

> If you use AI without understanding what it produces, you take a technical risk.
> If you do understand it, you expand your ability to explore, create, and decide.

### ⚖️ The Issue Isn’t the Tool — It’s the Way It’s Used

You shouldn’t feel ashamed of using AI.
But you might need to feel ashamed of:

* Integrating an answer without testing or validation,
* Copying a solution you don’t understand,
* Hiding the origin of generated code,
* Presenting as your own an idea you haven’t reformulated or thought through.

> Ethics of use comes before technology.

### 💬 Reclaiming the Right to Use Tools

Were we ashamed to use an IDE?
Were we ashamed to use libraries?
Were we ashamed of Stack Overflow?

The LLM is a new tool in this long chain of developer augmentation. Shame has no place here — lucidity does.

### ✊ Affirming a New Professional Pride

Pride isn’t in “doing everything by hand.”
It’s in the ability to:

* frame questions clearly,
* think interactively,
* produce responsible code,
* document choices,
* transmit design patterns,
* learn *with* AI, not *despite* it.

> This book isn’t inviting you to be a developer who “never cheats.”
> It’s inviting you to be a developer who **thinks better with the right tools**.

So no, you shouldn’t feel ashamed. You should be ready to talk about it, own it, and make it a lever — for quality, for transmission, for reflection.
