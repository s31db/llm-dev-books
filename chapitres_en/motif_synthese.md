### 🔚 To Conclude This Chapter — **The Dialogue Patterns**

---

#### ✅ Summary

This chapter invited you to **change how you look at interacting with an LLM**:
no longer as a series of isolated requests, but as a **structured design language** built around conversational patterns.

You’ve discovered:

* What a **dialogue pattern** is: a recurring problem, a typical response, an expected consequence.
* A first collection of patterns, such as **Socratic Questioning**, **Guided Exploration**, **Counterexample**, or **Test-Driven Prompting**.
* How these patterns are activated in real situations, in a **dialogue conceived as a design tool**.

These patterns aren’t recipes or rules; they’re **living forms of use** — cultivated, adapted, combined.

#### 🧩 Recap Sheet — The First 8 Patterns of the LLM-Assisted Software Design Language

| 🎯 Pattern                   | 🔢 Main Purpose                        | 💡 Key Gesture | 🧠 Recommended Posture | 💬 Prompt to Remember     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Socratic Questioning**  | Clarify a vague need | Ask targeted questions | Become a facilitator of your own thinking | *“Help me clarify my request by asking me questions.”* |
| **2. Guided Exploration**    | Structure a complex subject            | Ask for a breakdown or plan | Explore without trying to solve everything at once | *“Propose a step-by-step plan to tackle this subject.”*   |
| **3. Reverse Specification** | Understand undocumented code           | Infer intentions from code | Interpret, reformulate, cross-check                | *“What business rules does this code implement?”*    |
| **4. Mirror Model**          | Compare options before choosing        | Generate several solutions then compare | Don’t rush; open up the decision space             | *“Propose 2 or 3 options and compare them on these criteria…”* |
| **5. Counterexample**        | Test a solution’s robustness           | Ask for a failing case                  | Adopt a critical posture, push to the limit        | *“What situation would make this solution invalid?”*    |
| **6. Test-Driven Prompting** | Stabilize answer quality               | Define expectations before writing      | Treat the prompt as a testable artifact            | *“Here’s an example of expected output. What should be in the prompt?”* |
| **7. Visual Reformulation**  | Detect fuzziness in a textual solution | Represent visually then reformulate     | Clarify by sketching, dialog from the diagram      | *“Here’s my structured understanding. What’s missing?”* |
| **8. Systemic Care**         | Identify the root causes of a problem  | Investigate through causal questioning  | Pause action to investigate deeply                 | *“Can you help me explore the root causes of this problem?”* |

#### 🛠 How to Use It

* ✅ In **LLM interaction reviews**: identify which pattern fits your current situation.
* 🌀 In **team workshops**: propose a situation → pick a pattern → experiment.
* 🧭 In **coaching/mentoring**: train on the reflective gestures associated with each pattern.
* 📓 In **practice documentation**: add them to your workshop templates, Miro boards, or augmented-facilitation tools.
