### 🎭 Two Ordinary Stories

We’ve seen that shame isn’t usually an individual symptom but often a reflection of a collective that doesn’t yet know how to welcome AI use.

Beyond principles, there are the small, everyday gestures:
What we dare to say — or not.
What we hide in a browser tab.
What we share, or keep to ourselves.

To extend that reflection, here are two stories inspired by real situations.
Two ways of interacting with AI.
Two postures. Two team climates.

One happens in silence.
The other turns into collective learning.

### 🪞 **What We Don’t Say**

Maxime has been a developer for seven years. He likes clean code, tests that pass the first time, well-tied specs. A rigorous dev. A “real” one, as he puts it.

This morning, he’s stuck on a JSON parsing feature. Something messy, ill-defined, with edge cases. He’s been spinning his wheels for an hour. Nothing works. Sprint’s almost over.

He glances around. No one’s paying attention.
He opens a private tab. Types quickly into ChatGPT:

> *“How do you parse a JSON with nested relations in Java?”*

A few seconds later, the answer appears. Simple. Effective. Surprisingly clear.

He feels a twinge. Too easy.
But he copies, adapts a couple of lines.
The tests pass. He commits:

```bash
git commit -m "implement JSON parsing"
```

No mention of AI. Not even a comment in the code.

Next day at the daily, Adrien looks at the PR:

> — Nice! Did you come up with this pattern?
> Maxime nods:
> — I… did some research.

Nobody says anything. On to the next person.

But Maxime feels a hollow spot. He feels like he cheated.
He tells himself he’ll come back later to really understand.
He won’t.

That evening, scrolling LinkedIn, he sees a viral post:

> *“Developers who outsource to AI are just assemblers now. Sad times.”*

He doesn’t like it. He doesn’t comment.
He closes the app. A small knot stays in his stomach.
He delivered on time. The code works. No one blamed him.

But deep down, he doubts.

### 🌱 **What We Cultivate**

Sarah isn’t the type to keep things to herself. A full-stack dev for five years, she enjoys coding as much as thinking about how the team collaborates. She recently proposed adding an “AI watch” time in retrospectives. “So we stop running our tests in our own corners.”

This morning she starts a new task with Léo, a junior who just joined the team.
High-stakes feature: synchronizing two authentication systems.

Sarah opens her editor, then a separate `.md` file.

> — Let’s start with some prompting together. Just to explore.

Léo hesitates.

> — We’re not going to code directly?
> — We will, but look — this keeps us from locking into one approach.

She types:

> Context: We need to make two login systems (LDAP and OAuth) coexist in the same backend app.
> Prompt: Give 3 possible strategies with pros/cons for this scenario.

ChatGPT proposes three well-structured options.

Ils lisent ensemble. Sarah ne choisit pas pour Léo. Elle demande :

They read together. Sarah doesn’t choose for Léo. She asks:

> — Which one do you find easiest to test?
> — The second. But we’d need to avoid spaghetti.

They tweak the prompt. Ask for an example. Then another with a security twist. They discuss, laugh sometimes — when the AI suggests something absurd.
In the end they code an adapted version from the second scenario.

In the PR, Sarah adds a note at the bottom of the feature’s `README.md`:

> 🧠 **AI Exploration**
> Prompt used: comparing login strategies
> Response kept: option 2 (adapted)
> Discussion in pair: Léo + Sarah
> Lesson: the prompt helped us make security needs explicit before coding.

In retro, she shares the experience:

> — What I liked was that it forced us to clarify our expectations. And Léo got to see several solutions right away.

Tom, the architect, jumps in:

> — Can you add it to the prompts repo? This case will come up again.

Sarah smiles.
She feels no shame, no discomfort.
Just the satisfaction of having passed something on.
And of turning AI into a tool for the team — not a secret productivity hack.

### 🧩 What These Stories Reveal

These two stories tell far more than prompts or commits.
They show what happens **when technology meets the human factor**:

* The first story is about **silence**, avoidance, fear of judgment.
  It shows how AI use can lead to **withdrawal**, even among competent developers.

* The second is about **dialogue**, reflexivity, sharing.
  It shows how owning AI use can become a **lever for collective growth**.

The difference isn’t the tool or technical level.
It’s the environment. The team culture. What’s possible, allowed, valued.

**Creating a “no-shame” culture around AI is a shared responsibility.**
It takes rituals, spaces to talk, and frameworks where mistakes turn into learning.

Because ultimately, the issue isn’t whether to use AI.
The issue is **staying human in how we use it** — and in how we talk about it together.
