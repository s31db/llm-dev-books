> After exploring ideas and patterns, it’s time to put them into action.
> Here are tools you can start using, adapting, and evolving in your projects today.

### 🧰 Tool Sheet 1 — LLM Interaction Pattern

> Fill this out to document a pattern you’ve observed, experimented with, or shared.

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Pattern name** | Short, evocative title |
| **Usage context** | When and why does this pattern get activated? |
| **Problem addressed** | What recurring issue does this pattern help solve? |
| **Typical prompt form** | Generic example of how to phrase it |
| **Recommended approach** | Steps or sequence of interactions |
| **Positive consequences** | What this pattern enables or strengthens |
| **Variants or adaptations** | Examples of how to adjust depending on context (individual, team, language…) |
| **Points of caution** | Risks, limits, common pitfalls |
| **Real-world examples** | Project, situation, concrete anecdote |
| **Tags** | Associated themes (exploration, refactor, testing, documentation, security…) |

### 🎯 Tool Sheet 2 — Prompt Design

> Use this to design or improve a prompt in a real use case.

| Element                          | Content                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt title or goal**         | What you expect from the interaction                    |
| **Context provided to the LLM**  | Language, framework, business constraints, user’s level |
| **Task requested**               | Action or output expected                               |
| **Specific intentions**          | Why this prompt matters, what purpose it serves         |
| **Desired response format**      | Code, text, table, summary, diagram…                    |
| **Expectation tests (optional)** | Examples of valid outputs or success criteria (→ TDP)   |
| **Variants to try**              | Possible rephrasings or added details                   |
| **Lessons learned**              | What worked well / what didn’t                          |

### 🧪 Tool Sheet 3 — Test-Driven Prompting (TDP)

> Formalize your expectations before writing the prompt.

| Element                    | Content |
|----------------------------|-|
| **Prompt name or purpose** | |
| **Inputs provided to the LLM** | (e.g. source code, business context, sample data) |
| **Expected output type 1** | Example of an ideal response |
| **Expected output type 2 (variant)** | |
| **Formal constraints**     | Length, tone, format, style, forbidden content |
| **Failure criteria**       | What makes a response unusable |
| **Associated prompt**      | To be constructed in line with the above tests |

### 📋 Tool Sheet 4 — LLM Interaction Retrospective

> Document a significant interaction with an LLM (success or failure).

| Element                          | Detail                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Date & context**               | Project, stage, objective              |

| **Response obtained**            | Summary or excerpt                     |
| **Satisfaction? (🟢🟡🔴)**       | Rate its relevance or usefulness       |
| **What worked well**             |                                        |
| **What was problematic**         | (hallucination, confusion, bias, etc.) |
| **Lessons learned**              |                                        |
