## 🎯 Annex 5 — **The Augmented Agile Coach: Enhancing Your Support with an LLM**

> An LLM doesn’t replace the human dimension of coaching. But it can become a **quiet ally**, an **amplifier of questioning**, a **mirror of team dynamics**, even a **catalyst for collective intelligence**.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Explore how a coach, facilitator or Scrum Master can **integrate LLMs into their daily practice** to support individual reflection, equip teams, and shift perspectives within a systemic logic.

| Supporting a blocked team | Co-create a map of hypotheses or possible causes |
| Designing a ritual | Draw inspiration from hybrid rituals or generate icebreakers |
| Observing team dynamics | Simulate scenarios or viewpoints |
| Supporting reflexivity | Use the LLM as a dialogic mirror |

### 🧰 Tips & Tactics

* 💬 **Think out loud with the LLM**: let yourself be surprised by your own phrasing.
* 🧭 **Use motifs as canvases** to prepare interventions (Guided Exploration, Clarification, Mirror…).
* 📚 **Create a library of educational or workshop prompts** for use in group facilitation.
* 🧠 **Coach a role with the LLM**: simulate a posture, identify blind spots.
* 🧪 **Prototype a delicate situation before going in**, through a simulated dialogue with the LLM.

---

### ⚠️ Points of Attention

* An LLM **doesn’t perceive emotion or non-verbal cues**: it’s a tool, not a relational being.
* It **can normalize or rationalize** what’s actually emergent, ambiguous or alive.
* It never replaces **presence, active listening, or human discernment**.

### 🛠 Going Further

* Use the LLM **as an intervision partner**: replay a situation to review it from another angle.
* Introduce the LLM **as a paired “augmented participant”** in a workshop.
* Integrate motifs into **agility or coaching training** as tools for an augmented posture.

> **The augmented coach** isn’t an automation of facilitation. They’re a human who chooses when, how and why to enter into conversation with an AI. They observe their own biases, shift blind spots, and experiment with new paths—always in service of relationship and collective clarity.
