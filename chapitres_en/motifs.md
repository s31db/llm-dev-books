## 🛠️ Chapter 6 — Bringing Patterns Into Everyday Work: Between Individual Practice and Team Habits

> A pattern only has value if it’s lived, adapted, and shared. This chapter offers concrete ways to **anchor patterns in your daily work**, whether you’re solo or part of a team.

### 🔹 Individual Practice: A Long-Term Dialogue

#### 🧑‍💻 1. Working With an LLM as a Personal Partner

An LLM can become:

* a thinking companion,
* an option simulator,
* a technical adviser,
* a mirror for your own thinking.

> It doesn’t replace your expertise. It amplifies it — if you know how to ask the right questions.

#### 🌱 2. Developing Your Personal Patterns

Through experimentation, you’ll discover your own effective sequences. For example:

* A prompt style that works best for you,
* A way to introduce project context,
* A method to obtain a usable answer.

Document them. Give them a name. Share them.

> A good pattern is often **born from a frustration** that you’ve successfully overcome.

#### 📘 3. Building a “Personal Prompt Library”

Keep track of your best interactions:

* What worked,
* What failed,
* What you reformulated.

Use a note-taking app, a knowledge-management tool (e.g. Obsidian, Notion), or a simple Markdown file. This base becomes a **learning and transmission repository**.

### 🤝 Team Practices: Building a Shared Language

#### 👥 1. Sharing Lived Patterns

During a stand-up, a review, or a debrief:

* “Which pattern did you use?”
* “How did you build that prompt?”
* “What intent tests did you set?”

These questions make the team’s **conversational practice with AI visible**.

#### 🧩 2. Pattern-Augmented Reviews

In code review, add a “dialogue with the LLM” dimension:

* Show the prompts used,
* Explain the trade-offs made with the AI,
* Question the reliability or logic of certain suggestions.

> You’re no longer just reviewing the code: you’re reviewing **the reasoning path** that led there.

#### ✨ 3. Dialogued Design in Pairs

Two teammates work with an LLM:
🧑‍💻 One asks the questions,
👂 One observes, reformulates, proposes a variation.
The prompt becomes a **shared object**, **built by two**, **tested together**.

This ritual can bring forth **team patterns**:
→ “Here’s our way of exploring a design.”
→ “Here’s our refactoring template.”

### 🛠 Possible Workshops

| Workshop | Goal | Duration | Format |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Patterns in Code Review** | Identify patterns used / to improve | 30 min | Pair review |
| **Prompt Kata**             | Practice a pattern in a guided situation    | 45–60 min | Workshop in pairs      |
| **Usage Mapping**           | Identify patterns used by the team          | 45 min | Wall or Miro workshop |
| **Conversation Retros**     | Share a successful or failed interaction    | 15 min | Stand-up or retro      |
| **Team Pattern Creation**   | Formalize a pattern experienced by the team | 60 min | Collaborative workshop |

### 📚 Case Study: A Team Building Its Own Language

An agile team decides to create its own “dialect” for interacting with LLMs. Each sprint it:

* documents effective prompts,
* formalizes emerging patterns,
* builds a shared “prompt book.”

Over time, these elements become:

* **training supports** for newcomers,
* **discussion tools** in retros or reviews,
* **invariants** in their design practice.

> **The Friday Workshop**
>
> In one Toulouse-based team, every Friday morning is dedicated to an “AI Workshop.” Each member shares a notable interaction with an LLM from the week. An online Kanban board tracks patterns used, prompts tested, and results obtained. This has helped the team not only improve prompt quality but also create a living, common reference fed by everyone’s experiences.

#### Creating a Supportive Environment

Certain cultural and organizational prerequisites make integrating patterns much easier:

* **A culture of experimentation**: allow developers to try approaches without fear of failure.
* **Trust in autonomy**: let teams choose when and how to interact with LLMs.
* **Recognition of reflective time**: value not just immediate production but also time spent dialoguing and reformulating.

#### Tools and Supports

Several tools can facilitate pattern use in professional contexts:

* **Contextualized prompt libraries**, classified by task type (refactoring, documentation, testing, modeling, etc.).
* **Visual canvases** to guide complex dialogues (e.g., decision trees to refine architectures).
* **IDE extensions** integrating the most frequent patterns as shortcuts or built-in assistants.

### ✏️ In Summary

* Patterns become powerful **when they’re shared and embodied.**
* Working with an LLM is a living practice that **benefits from being narrated.**
* The pattern language is a **tool for alignment, reflection, and transmission.**

> An augmented team isn’t a team that simply uses an AI.
> It’s a team that **learns to dialogue with it — together.**
