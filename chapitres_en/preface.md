## <a id="preface"></a>Preface

Software is a craft. Since the dawn of computing, the best developers have done more than write code: they imagine architectures, explore ideas, test hypotheses, and weave a constant conversation between problem and solution, between intention and implementation.

Today, that conversation is taking a new turn. The rise of Large Language Models — *LLMs* — is transforming the way we approach software design. Not simply because they can generate code on the fly, but because they offer an entirely new space for interaction: a natural interface for thinking, framing, iterating, clarifying, and refining our intentions.

In the face of this quiet revolution, developers now find themselves in an unprecedented position. They are no longer only code writers, but architects of a dialogue between humans and machines; curators of the meaning produced; mediators of a new form of distributed intelligence. This calls for a deep evolution of our tools, our practices… and our cultural references.

This book proposes to respond to that need through a *pattern language* — a flexible yet structuring grammar, inspired both by software design patterns and by Christopher Alexander’s pioneering work in architecture. It is not a technical manual or an AI tool tutorial. It is a guide to a new posture, a practice grounded in experience, and an invitation to experiment with a different relationship to software design.

Each pattern describes a concrete situation, a recurring problem, and a proven way to address it in interaction with an LLM. Whether it’s about framing an effective prompt, conducting an architectural exploration, documenting a design choice, or unblocking a dead end, the patterns speak to individuals and teams alike — to developers as much as facilitators.

Running throughout this book is a vision of software development as a reflective, dialogical, and collective practice. It argues for a fruitful hybridization between human logic and computational capabilities, between technical rigor and exploratory intuition. It offers a framework not to endure AI but to inhabit it; to make LLMs not mere assistants, but true partners in design.

We hope this pattern language will become, for you as reader, a fabric for experimentation, appropriation, and transmission. Whether you are a developer, an architect, a teacher, a student, or a researcher, you will find signposts here to navigate this new landscape. And perhaps, in turn, you’ll be inspired to add your own patterns, drawn from your context, your creativity, your craft.

Welcome to the conversation.
