## 🧰 Chapitre 3 — Dialogue Patterns: Building a Design Language with LLMs

> *Designing with an LLM is more than writing prompts. It’s practicing an art of dialogue. This chapter offers a library of **conversational patterns** — typical interaction sequences, drawn from the field, reusable and adaptable.*

### Why a Pattern Language?

In software development, certain situations repeat endlessly: framing a fuzzy need, exploring technical options, understanding inherited code, choosing an architecture. With an LLM, these situations take a new shape — but the **recurring use cases remain**.

> A pattern is a **recurring form of effective interaction** in a given context. It doesn’t dictate what to do, but offers a **frame for doing it well**.

### 🔧 Structure of a Pattern

Each pattern follows a clear structure:

* **Name**: a memorable label
* **Context**: when the pattern applies
* **Problem**: what’s blocking progress
* **Solution**: the recommended posture or form of interaction
* **Consequences**: what this enables
* **Example**: a real or inspired case
* **Variants (optional)**: useful declinations
* **Associated Tools (optional)**: IDEs, plug-ins, canvases…
