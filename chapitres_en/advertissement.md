> *This English edition is based on the original French book **LLM-Assisted Software Design — Un langage de motifs pour les nouvelles pratiques de conception logicielle** (Samuel Bastiat, July 2025). It has been translated and adapted into U.S. English with the continued collaboration of a Large Language Model, reflecting the same co-creation spirit that shaped the original edition.*

### 🌐 *Relevance Today*

Since the first French edition, large language models have advanced rapidly — becoming more context-aware, multimodal, and capable of sustaining longer, more consistent dialogues.

While the **core pattern language remains valid**, its application now benefits from stronger tools and wider community feedback. The principles of “augmented development” — clarity of intent, shared practices, and critical supervision — are even more relevant in 2025–2026, as teams move from experimenting with LLMs to embedding them sustainably in their workflows.

This edition therefore stays coherent with the current state of LLMs while preserving the exploratory and ethical posture of the original book: an open, evolving guide rather than a fixed manual.
