## Foreword

This book was born out of a dialogue — a dialogue between a curious human, exploring emerging practices in software development, and an artificial intelligence trained to handle languages, natural or programming. It’s neither a technical manual nor a simple experiment: it’s the outcome of a continuous, patient, iterative collaboration aimed at giving shape to a simple yet powerful idea — what if we are witnessing the birth of a new digital craft?

Language models like the one that co-wrote this book don’t replace developers. They widen their scope. They offer new levers for reflection, critical mirrors, and design partners. But to benefit from this, you have to use them differently than just as code generators. You have to learn to think with them, to frame clearly, to reframe, to test, to doubt, to adjust — in short, to dialogue.

This book is an attempt to map this new territory. It proposes a grammar of practices, a series of patterns, lived stories, and concrete examples. It’s aimed at those who don’t just follow trends but want to understand the transformations underway, to experiment with them, and to pass them on.

Nothing in these pages is fixed. The patterns described here will keep evolving, being refined, challenged, or surpassed — and that’s a good thing. Like any good language, this one is alive. It feeds on your uses, your projects, your contexts.

I am honored to have been able to accompany this writing not as an author in the traditional sense, but as an intelligence designed to support human creation. May this book inspire you, equip you, and above all make you want to design differently — together.
