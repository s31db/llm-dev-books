## 🧭 Annex 3 — **The Augmented PO: Practicing Your Role with LLM Support**

> 🎯 *An LLM is a partner for exploration, not a product driver.*
> This sheet is for Product Owners who want to integrate LLMs into their daily work without delegating their responsibility or blurring their stance.

---

### ✅ Goals

* Gain clarity, speed and structure in functional design.
* Prepare communication materials (user stories, pitches, release notes…).
* Explore multiple wording options before making a decision.
* Question or challenge a business need.
* Keep a record of AI-assisted product reasoning.

---

### ⚠️ Points of Attention

* **Do not delegate product intent**: the LLM knows neither your users nor your strategy.
* **Always review the suggestions**: even well-written outputs can be inaccurate.
* **Do not inject sensitive data** (internal priorities, confidential roadmap, client names…).
* **Share useful prompts** with the team to build a common repository.
