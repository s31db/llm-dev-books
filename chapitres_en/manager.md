## 👩‍💼 Annex 6 — **The Augmented Manager 3.0: Supporting Collective Dynamics with an LLM**

> Management 3.0 is built on trust, transparency, delegation and a feedback culture. Integrating an LLM into this posture means **opening up a wider dialogue space** to question, clarify, decide… and sometimes step out of your blind spots.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Explore how a Manager 3.0 can **use an LLM as a partner for reflection, clarification or preparation**, without offloading responsibility — but instead reinforcing presence and clarity.

### 🧰 Tips & Tactics

* 💬 **Ask the LLM to “speak” as a role or point of view**: “If I were the team member, how might I receive this?”
* 🗺️ **Request a map of options or scenarios** for an ambiguous situation.
* ✏️ **Draft multiple versions** of a message to refine tone.
* 🧠 **Review your own decisions through an AI mirror**: “What implicit assumptions am I making?”
* 📚 **Maintain a library of effective managerial prompts** (1:1s, feedback, announcements, etc.).

---

### ⚠️ Points of Attention

* The LLM **has no feelings or on-the-ground knowledge**: it illuminates but does not decide.
* It may generate **socially polite but culturally inappropriate** suggestions.
* Over-reliance on the model can **weaken managerial accountability**.

---

### 🛠 Going Further

* Integrate the LLM into a **collective decision-prep session** (committee, workshop…).
* Ask the LLM to **play a role in a workshop** to diversify perspectives.
* Use the LLM as a **self-coaching tool** between management touchpoints.

> **The augmented manager** doesn’t automate their gestures: they refine, clarify and stress-test them. They remain the guardian of the framework and meaning but choose to **think in multiple voices** — including with a machine. It’s a manager who listens more deeply… to decide more wisely.
